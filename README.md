# ML-based-stock-prices
 In this project,i with my team successfully extracted, analyzed, and predicted the stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) using historical data from 2000 to 2023. We performed various tasks including data extraction, preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, and model training. By calculating velocity and acceleration, we gained insights into the rate of change and trend patterns of stock prices. We then utilized a linear regression model to predict future prices and evaluated its performance using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric.  The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in financial data analysis and prediction. It showcases the importance of feature engineering and visualization in understanding and predicting stock market trends.
